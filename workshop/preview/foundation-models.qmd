# Foundation Models: The Cornerstones of Modern AI

## Overview

Foundation models (FM) are deep learning models trained on massive raw unlabelled datasets usually through self-supervised learning. FMs enable todayâ€™s data scientists to use them as the base and fine-tune using domain specific data to obtain models that can handle a wide range of tasks [1, 6, 7]. In this talk, we provide an introduction to FMs, its history, evolution, and go through its key features and categories, and a few examples. We also briefly discuss how foundation models work. This talk will be a precursor to the hands-on session that follows on the same topic.

In this session, we take a closer look at what constitutes a foundation model, a few examples, and some basic principles around how it works.

## Outline 
1. Introduction to foundation models, its history and evolution
2. Key features of foundation models
  * Types of foundation models: Language, Vision, Generative, and Multimodal
3. Examples of foundation models: BERT [3], GPT [4], YOLO [2], SAM [5], DALLE-2
4. How do foundation models work?

# Hands-On Lab: Foundation Models

## Overview
The hands-on lab on foundation models will focus on building and applying small-scale foundation models for some example use cases. The main goal of this 1-hour session will be to get more familiarized with foundation models and in interacting with them.

## Outline
1. Image Segmentation using Segment Anything Model (SAM)
2. Chatbot using LLMs + RAG
